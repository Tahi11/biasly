"Imagine walking down the street and seeing advertising screens change their content based on how you walk, how you talk, or even the shape of your chest.",,,,,
"These screens rely on hidden cameras, microphones and computers to guess if you're male or female.",,,,,
"This might sound futuristic, but patrons in a Norwegian pizzeria discovered it's exactly what was happening: Women were seeing ads for salad and men were seeing ads for meat options.",,,,,
The software running a digital advertising board spilled the beans when it crashed and displayed its underlying code.,,,,,
The motivation behind using this technology might have been to improve advertising quality or user experience.,,,,,
"Nevertheless, many customers were unpleasantly surprised by it.",,,,,
This sort of situation is not just creepy and invasive.,,,,,
"It's worse: Efforts at automatic gender recognition using algorithms to guess a person's gender based on images, video or audio raise significant social and ethical concerns that are not yet fully explored.",,,,,
Most current research on automatic gender recognition technologies focuses instead on technological details.,,,,,
"Our recent research found that people with diverse gender identities, including those identifying as transgender or gender nonbinary, are particularly concerned that these systems could miscategorize them.",,,,,
People who express their gender differently from stereotypical male and female norms already experience discrimination and harm as a result of being miscategorized or misunderstood.,,,,,
"Ideally, technology designers should develop systems to make these problems less common, not more so.",,,,,
"Using algorithms to classify people as digital technologies become more powerful and sophisticated, their designers are trying to use them to identify and categorize complex human characteristics, such as sexual orientation, gender and ethnicity.",,,,,
"The idea is that with enough training on abundant user data, algorithms can learn to analyze people's appearance and behavior ‰ÛÒ and perhaps one day characterize people as well as, or even better than, other humans do.",,,,,
How machine learning works.,,,,,
Gender is a hard topic for people to handle.,,,,,
It's a complex concept with important roles both as a cultural construct and a core aspect of an individual's identity.,,,,,
"Researchers, scholars and activists are increasingly revealing the diverse, fluid and multifaceted aspects of gender.",,,,,
"In the process, they find that ignoring this diversity can lead to both harmful experiences and social injustice.",,,,,
"For example, according to the 2016 National Transgender Survey, 47 percent of transgender participants stated that they had experienced some form of discrimination at their workplace due to their gender identity.",,,,,
"More than half of transgender people who were harassed, assaulted or expelled because of their gender identity had attempted suicide.",,,,,
"Many people have, at one time or another, been surprised, or confused or even angered to find themselves mistaken for a person of another gender.",,,,,
"Effects of automatic gender recognition In our recent research, we interviewed 13 transgender and gender-nonconforming people, about their general impressions of automatic gender recognition technology.",,,,,
We also asked them to describe their responses to imaginary future scenarios where they might encounter it.,,,,,
All 13 participants were worried about this technology and doubted whether it could offer their community any benefits.,,,,,
"Of particular concern was the prospect of being misgendered by it; in their experience, gender is largely an internal, subjective characteristic, not something that is necessarily or entirely expressed outwardly.",,,,,
"Therefore, neither humans nor algorithms can accurately read gender through physical features, such as the face, body or voice.",,,,,
They described how being misgendered by algorithms could potentially feel worse than if humans did it.,,,,,
"Technology is often perceived or believed to be objective and unbiased, so being wrongly categorized by an algorithm would emphasize the misconception that a transgender identity is inauthentic.",,,,,
One participant described how they would feel hurt if a million-dollar piece of software developed by however many people decided that they are not who they themselves believe they are.,,,,,
"Privacy and transparency The people we interviewed shared the common public concern that automated cameras could be used for surveillance without their consent or knowledge; for years, researchers and activists have raised red flags about increasing threats to privacy in a world populated by sensors and cameras.",,,,,
Facial recognition software can scan a crowd of people as they walk by.,,,,,
But our participants described how the effects of these technologies could be greater for transgender people.,,,,,
"For instance, they might be singled out as unusual because they look or behave differently from what the underlying algorithms expect.",,,,,
Some participants were even concerned that systems might falsely determine that they are trying to be someone else and deceive the system.,,,,,
"Their concerns also extended to cisgender people who might look or act differently from the majority, such as people of different races, people the algorithms perceive as androgynous, and people with unique facial structures.",,,,,
"This already happens to people from minority racial and ethnic backgrounds, who are regularly misidentified by facial recognition technology.",,,,,
"For example, existing facial recognition technology in some cameras fail to properly detect the faces of Asian users and send messages for them to stop blinking or to open their eyes.",,,,,
Our interviewees wanted to know more about how automatic gender recognition systems work and what they're used for.,,,,,
"They didn't want to know deep technical details, but did want to make sure the technology would not compromise their privacy or identity.",,,,,
"They also wanted more transgender people involved in the early stages of design and development of these systems, well before they are deployed.",,,,,
Creating inclusive automatic systems Our results demonstrate how designers of automatic categorization technologies can inadvertently cause harm by making assumptions about the simplicity and predictability of human characteristics.,,,,,
Our research adds to a growing body of work that attempts to more thoughtfully incorporate gender into technology.,,,,,
"Minorities have historically been left out of conversations about large-scale technology deployment, including ethnic minorities and people with disabilities.",,,,,
"Yet, scientists and designers alike know that including input from minority groups during the design process can lead to technical innovations that benefit all people.",,,,,
We advocate for a more gender-inclusive and human-centric approach to automation that incorporates diverse perspectives.,,,,,
"As digital technologies develop and mature, they can lead to impressive innovations.",,,,,
"But as humans direct that work, they should avoid amplifying human biases and prejudices that are negative and limiting.",,,,,
"In the case of automatic gender recognition, we do not necessarily conclude that these algorithms should be abandoned.",,,,,
"Rather, designers of these systems should be inclusive of, and sensitive to, the diversity and complexity of human identity.",,,,,
Google isn't the only Silicon Valley employer being accused of hostility to white men.,,,,,
Yahoo! Inc. and Tata Consultancy Services Ltd. were already fighting discrimination lawsuits brought by white men before Google engineer James Damore ignited a firestorm -- and got himself fired -- with an internal memo criticizing the company's diversity efforts and claiming women are biologically less suited than men to be engineers.,,,,,
"The Yahoo case began last year when two men sued, claiming they'd been unfairly fired after managers allegedly manipulated performance evaluations to favor women.",,,,,
"They claim Marissa Mayer approved the review process and was involved in their terminations, and last month a judge ordered the former chief executive be deposed.",,,,,
"TCS, meanwhile, is fighting three men who claim the Mumbai-based firm discriminates against non-Indians at its U.S.A offices.",,,,,
"Trump has ordered a review of affirmative action policies in higher education, proposed banning transgender people in the military and advocated curbing immigration of non-English speakers to the delight of conservatives who say they've been muzzled by liberals.",,,,,
"While gender discrimination complaints aren't uncommon in the tech industry, they are usually made by women, whoÊare outnumbered by nearly 3 to 1.",,,,,
Ellen Pao put Silicon Valley's Bro Culture front and center in 2015 during a trial pitting her against the venture capital firm Kleiner Perkins Caufield & Byers.,,,,,
She claimed there was a sexually charged atmosphere where men preyed on their female coworkers and that she'd been blocked from promotion and fired for her gender.,,,,,
"She lost, but the trial rallied other women to speak out.",,,,,
That year Microsoft Corp. and Twitter Inc. were both sued on behalf of female engineers claiming men are favored for advancement.,,,,,
"This year, Travis Kalanick was ousted as Uber Technologies Inc. CEO after allegations of rampant sexual harassment at the company.",,,,,
"Over 10 pages, he complained that efforts at Google to boost diversity were themselves a form of discrimination that are unfair, divisive, and bad for business.",,,,,
He filed a complaint with a federal labor board last Monday and says Google smeared his reputation by firing him.,,,,,
"He told Bloomberg he planned to take further legal action, though he declined to say on what grounds.",,,,,
"Women eventually accounted for more than 80 percent of the top management positions in the media division, according to the suit.",,,,,
" Yahoo denies wrongdoing and argued against Mayer's deposition, saying she had no special knowledge of the circumstances surrounding the firings of Ard and Gregory Anderson, another online newsÊeditor who said he was fired, along with hundreds of staffers, in 2014.",,,,,
"AÊYahoo spokeswoman defended the performance review process in February 2016 after Anderson filed his complaint, saying fairness is a guiding principle.",,,,,
"Anderson was slated for termination in April 2014 because he was on the bad managers list, Yahoo said in a filing last month.",,,,,
The evaluation process ranked him in the bottom 5 percent.,,,,,
"Mayer, who isn't a defendant, couldn't be reached for comment and it isn't clear from court filings whether she's already given her deposition.",,,,,
"She was CEO from 2012 until June, when Verizon Communications Inc. completed its acquisition of Yahoo's internet assets.",,,,,
"Verizon's Oath, the unit that includes Yahoo's assets, declined to comment on the Mayer deposition.",,,,,
The men's attorney didn't respond to requests for comment.,,,,,
"The case against TCS was filed in 2015 by Steven Heldt, a white U.S.-born IT worker who accused the company of grossly disproportionate favoritism toward hiring people of South Asian descent.",,,,,
"Heldt, who said he was terminated after about 20 months, claims he experienced substantial anti-American sentiment during his time there.",,,,,
"TCS calls their claims unfounded, arguing the men haven't proven of a pattern of discrimination, in part because their statistical analysis doesn't properly account for foreign workers legally hired with U.S. work visas.",,,,,
"Next month the men will ask a judge to allow potentially thousands of non-Indians who say they were  either blocked from jobs or, if hired, benched and eventually fired, to be included in their suit.",,,,,
TCS says their case isn't suited to be a class action based on common allegations for all job seekers because it uses varied hiring methods -- some applicants go directly through the company while others are recruited by outside vendors.,,,,,
Federal Science Minister Kirsty Duncan has made it clear that gender equity in science is a big priority for her.,,,,,
Now she's looking beyond universities to scientists employed by the federal government.,,,,,
"Duncan said in an interview in Toronto this week that she has asked science-based departments in the federal government to collect demographic data about their staff following a union survey that found:42 per cent of female federal scientists, engineers and researchers who responded thought gender bias was a career barrier.",,,,,
27 per cent believe men are favoured in opportunities for leadership roles.,,,,,
"The survey was released in March by the Professional Institute of the Public Service of Canada (PIPSC), which represents more than 15,000 federal scientists, engineers and researchers in 40 science-based departments and agencies.",,,,,
Duncan says up-to-date data about the makeup of the federal science workforce will be important for planning purposes as older scientists retire.,,,,,
"(Paul Sakuma/Associated Press)Duncan said she had already asked Ian Stewart, the new head of the National Research Council, ""What do our stats look like""?",,,,,
"The NRC has since completed ""a large study,"" and she is asking for similar data from the deputy ministers of all other science-based departments.",,,,,
"Scientists at the NRC were one of two groups (the other being a group of researchers spread across many federal departments) flagged by the union as having the lowest representation of women compared to the pool of qualified women in the workforce available to be hired, based on its own analysis from its member database and from government science hiring competitions.",,,,,
"The analysis also found ""a diminishing proportion of women to men"" occupying higher-level positions in science departments.",,,,,
"The analysis is part of a report about gender bias that also includes results from the voluntary survey, conducted online by Environics Research between May 29 and June 27, 2017.",,,,,
"It was sent to 16,377 employees, and 3,025 (18 per cent) responded.",,,,,
"It included not only questions related to gender, but other issues such as whether they feel they can speak freely about their work.",,,,,
"More than half of federal government scientists still feel muzzled, poll findsSusan O'Donnell, a member of the PIPSC science advisory committee and lead author of the PIPSC report, said the union is delighted the minister has asked for further research.",,,,,
Because it's clearly an issue that's not going to get better until the government devotes the attention and resources to it.,,,,,
Duncan suggested the data about the makeup of the federal science workforce will also be important for planning for the future as older scientists retire.,,,,,
"Diversity and excellence Gender equity is something Duncan, a former medical geographer who studied diseases like the 1918 Spanish flu pandemic, has already shown she is passionate about.",,,,,
"As a former scientist who happens to be a woman, it was not always easy, and I spent 25 years fighting for diversity in research.",,,,,
"Last year, she wrote an opinion piece about her experiences, including being paid in the bottom 10th percentile at her university and being told it was because she was a woman.",,,,,
We know that diversity and research excellence go hand in hand.,,,,,
"""We need different ideas, different perspectives"".",,,,,
"She gave several examples where male-dominated research has let women down, such as voice-recognition software calibrated to male voices, early airbags designed for men that injured women and children, and the first artificial heart valves, designed to fit a male-sized heart.",,,,,
But her passion isn't driven purely by pragmatism.,,,,,
She also cited stories she didn't expect to hear about the negative experiences that women are still having in science.,,,,,
"A lot of young would women would come up and cry in my arms, no exaggeration.",,,,,
And I was determined that I would take action.,,,,,
"The first move, she said, was reinstating the University College Academic Staff Survey that was cancelled by the previous Conservative government.",,,,,
"Science minister considers forcing universities to attract more female research chairs ""I need the data,"" she said of the survey.",,,,,
"""Are women progressing through the ranks at the same rate as male colleagues or Indigenous people or people from minority backgrounds or persons with disabilities, and are they making equal pay""?",,,,,
"More recently, Duncan implemented equity rules for the Canada Excellence Research Chairs program and threatened to withhold Canada Research Chairs funding from universities that don't meet equity targets set in 2006 within the next two years.",,,,,
Women made up 58 per cent of 24 recipients of the Canada 150 Research Chairs announced in March.,,,,,
"The program aims to attract researchers from abroad with offers of either $350,000 or $1 million a year for seven years.",,,,,
Not long ago I was talking to an engineering manager who was preparing performance reviews for his team.,,,,,
"He had two people he wanted to promote that year, but he was worried that his peers were only going to endorse one of them.",,,,,
She comes on too strong.,,,,,
Her male counterpart?,,,,,
"He needs to learn to be a little more patient, but who doesn't?",,,,,
"I don't know whether Jessica got her promotion, but the exchange got me wondering how often this perception of female abrasiveness undermines women's careers in technology.",,,,,
I focused on performance reviews for a couple of reasons.,,,,,
"First, reviews provide written documentation of people's perceptions.",,,,,
"Second, if I could collect a lot of reviews, I could get a statistical view of the situation.",,,,,
I asked men and women in tech if they would be willing to share their reviews for a study and didn't stipulate anything else.,,,,,
I figured only strong performers would be willing to share and was most interested in looking at the critical feedback that these strong performers had received.,,,,,
The reviews I collected were almost all positive.,,,,,
The question I wanted to answer was: Did review tone or content differed based on the employee's gender?,,,,,
I also wanted to know whether the manager's gender was a factor in how they reviewed their employees.,,,,,
I was especially interested in employees who shared reviews given by both male and female managers.,,,,,
"In all, I collected 248 reviews from 180 people, 105 men and 75 women.",,,,,
"The reviews come from 28 different companies and include large technology corporations, mid-size companies, and smaller environments.",,,,,
"I didn't see any impact of company size in the results, nor did I discover patterns unique to any individual company.",,,,,
Women's reviews are more likely to include critical feedback.,,,,,
The first thing I wanted to understand is how many reviews included critical wording in the first place.,,,,,
"These were almost exclusively strong reviews, so I wasn't sure.",,,,,
"My own reviews have all contained critical feedback, both those I've received and those I've given.",,,,,
But I wasn't sure what to expect.,,,,,
"105 men submitted 141 reviews, and 75 women submitted 107 reviews.",,,,,
"However, critical feedback was not distributed evenly by gender.",,,,,
"When breaking the reviews down by gender of the person evaluated, 58.",,,,,
9% of the reviews received by men contained critical feedback.,,,,,
Men are given constructive suggestions.,,,,,
Women are given constructive suggestions and told to pipe down.,,,,,
The kinds of observations my friend offers about his reports Jessica and Steve are pretty common.,,,,,
"In the 177 reviews where people receive critical feedback, men and women receive different kinds.",,,,,
The critical feedback men receive is heavily geared towards suggestions for additional skills to develop.,,,,,
A few examples: Constructive feedback on your performance as a feature crew tester can be summed up by saying that you still have some skills to continue to develop.,,,,,
Hone your strategies for guiding your team and developing their skills.,,,,,
It is important to set proper guidance around priorities and to help as needed in designs and product decisions.,,,,,
There were a few cases where it would have been extremely helpful if you had gone deeper into the details to help move an area forward.,,,,,
Take time to slow down and listen.,,,,,
You would achieve even more.,,,,,
Women receive this kind of constructive feedback too.,,,,,
"But the women's reviews include another, sharper element that is absent from the men's: You can come across as abrasive sometimes.",,,,,
"I know you don't mean to, but you need to pay attention to your tone.",,,,,
Your peers sometimes feel that you don't leave them enough room.,,,,,
Sometimes you need to step back to let others shine.,,,,,
"But along the way, we discovered many areas for improvement.",,,,,
"62 of the 248 reviews I collected were written by women, including 26 reviews of women and 36 reviews of men.",,,,,
"I did find some gender effects in the writing, for instance, the reviews written by women average almost 50% longer than those written by men, but none relevant to this study.",,,,,
"Female managers account for just over 23% of the negative critical feedback written in the reviews, which is close to what you'd expect given that they wrote 25% of the reviews to begin with.",,,,,
There's a common perception that women in technology endure personality feedback that their male peers just don't receive.,,,,,
"Words like bossy, abrasive, strident, and aggressive are used to describe women's behaviors when they lead; words like emotional and irrational describe their behaviors when they object.",,,,,
"All of these words show up at least twice in the women's review text I reviewed, some much more often.",,,,,
Abrasive alone is used 17 times to describe 13 different women.,,,,,
"Among these words, only aggressive shows up in men's reviews at all.",,,,,
"It shows up three times, twice with an exhortation to be more of it.",,,,,
"As a woman in tech who has been called all of these things before, there is some validation in confirming with data that the pattern is real.",,,,,
"But as a leader in tech, I'm aghast at how closely under our noses we let this live.",,,,,
I only have the data I have.,,,,,
"I don't know whether women were simply more willing to submit reviews that include critical language, or whether men removed language from their review documents before submitting.",,,,,
But the directional indication is striking and calls for further investigation by managers and HR departments.,,,,,
"At most mid-size or large tech companies, HR leaders supervise review scores to uncover and correct patterns of systematic bias.",,,,,
This is a call to action to bring the same rigor to the review language itself.,,,,,
" One of Silicon Valley's most famous venture capital firms prevailed on Friday over a former partner in a closely watched suit claiming gender discrimination, but hardly got away unscathed.",,,,,
"The plaintiff, Ellen Pao, had accused the firm, Kleiner Perkins Caufield & Byers, of discriminating against her in the course of her employment and eventual dismissal.",,,,,
The decision handed Kleiner a sweeping victory in a case that had mesmerized Silicon Valley with its salacious details while simultaneously amplifying concerns about the lack of diversity in the technology industry.,,,,,
"Even with her loss in the case, Ms. Pao's suit succeeded in prompting debate about women in technology and venture capital, said Deborah Rhode, a law professor at Stanford University.",,,,,
Should birth sex trump declared gender in prison?,,,,,
Should prisoner placement be based on biological sex rather than identified gender?,,,,,
"When a transgender inmate enters prison housing, should they be housed according to their biological sex, or the gender by which they identify?",,,,,
"According to Obama-era legislation, prison housing, like the use of public restrooms, should be determined by a person's identified gender.",,,,,
But President Donald Trump is on a roll to reverse a number of his predecessors legislative decisions says otherwise.,,,,,
"According to a recent announcement by the U.S. Bureau of prisons, an inmate's biological sex will now be used to determine where transgender prisoners are housed.",,,,,
"Because four women being held at a Texas detention center have filed a federal lawsuit arguing that the Obama decision (introduced just days before the 44th president left office) leaves them at greater risk of rape, because they might have to share facilities with transgender women.",,,,,
"Those who support Trump's reversal Ówho believe prisoners should be separated by biological sexÓ argue that prison is just a tough place full of tough people, and that the nuances of human sexuality are increasingly difficult to navigate within its walls.",,,,,
"Some point to the same argument that has been used to oppose trans people from using the bathrooms that coincide with their identities that is, who can say for sure that a twisted fox isn't trying to get into the henhouse?",,,,,
"Nancy Ayers, a spokesperson for the Bureau of Prisons reportedly told BuzzFeed News that the new policy takes into account the needs of all federal prisoners and articulates the balance of safety needs of transgender inmates as well as other inmates.",,,,,
"Prison blues Others argue this is just the latest blow to transgender rights and understanding, and simply highlights the administration's willingness to put the safety of non-trans prisoners above that of transgender individuals.",,,,,
"Reports indicate that transgender prisoners are some of the most likely to face physical, emotional and sexual abuse in prison, leading some to argue that rolling back the pre-existing protections for trans prisoners in this way doesn't do anything to improve the safety of prison systems overall, but merely shifts the danger from one group of people to another.",,,,,
A 2016 report from the Movement Advancement Project and the Center for American Progress reported that compared to the 1.,,,,,
"2 percent of heterosexual inmates report sexual assault by other inmates in prison and jails, 24.",,,,,
1 percent of trans inmates report at least one sexual assault.,,,,,
"Underlying the discussion is the Trump administration's vocal opposition to transgender rights, including its recent attempt to ban transgender people from serving in the military.",,,,,
Should prisoner placement be based on biological sex rather than identified gender?,,,,,
Where to be housed in the big house Finding a place for violators of the social contract By Marla Boone Transgender (adjective): denoting or relating to a person whose sense of personal identity and gender does not correspond with their birth sex.,,,,,
Transvestite (noun): a person who derives pleasure from dressing in clothes usually associated with the opposite sex.,,,,,
Transsexual (noun): a person who strongly identifies with the opposite gender so much so that they seek medical/surgical intervention to attain the physical characteristics of that opposite gender.,,,,,
"Social contract (noun): an implicit agreement among the members of a society to cooperate for social benefits, for example by sacrificing some individual freedom for state protection.",,,,,
"(Thomas Hobbes, John Locke, and Jean-Jacques Rousseau subscribed to the theory of a social contract as a means of explaining the origin of government and the obligations of citizens. ) Talk about a lose/lose proposition and how transgender prisoners be housed?",,,,,
By gender identification or by biological identification?,,,,,
"My original response was, Wherever they will be assaulted less.",,,,,
"After thinking about this for some time, I settled uneasily on the side of biological identification.",,,,,
It's a case of trying to do good by doing the right thing for the largest number of people even if the good isn't very good.,,,,,
"In 2013, the Williams Institute at the UCLA School of Law estimated there were 700,000 transgender adults in the United States.",,,,,
"By last year, it had doubled the number to 1.",,,,,
"That transgender community has been in the news a lot lately, due largely to recent government action.",,,,,
"One of the most disturbing aspects of my argument is that I find myself, for the first time ever, agreeing with something the country's president did.",,,,,
"On May 12, Mr. Trump reversed yet another one of his predecessor's actions, decreeing that now an inmate's biological sex will be used to make the initial decision as to where transgender prisoners are housed, instead of the gender by which they identify.",,,,,
"To make a determination about placement, a Transgender Executive Council can consider the inmate's health and safety, the inmate's history of behavior, and the security of the institution and its inmates.",,,,,
"According to the revisions, an inmate may also be assigned to a facility based on their self-identified gender if there has been significant progress towards transition as demonstrated by medical and mental health history.",,,,,
Prison wardens are permitted to recommend transferring an inmate based on their identified gender as well.,,,,,
"The reversal came about in part because Donald Trump seems bent upon undoing everything Barak Obama did, just because it was Obama who did it and in part due to a lawsuit brought by four female Texas prison inmates.",,,,,
"These women contend the previous prison guidelines, which allowed transgenders to be placed according to their gender identity, put them at greater risk of rape because they might have to share facilities with transgender women.",,,,,
"Following the changes made on the twelfth, prison authorities are now instructed to consider the health and safety of transgender inmates, as well as whether placement would threaten the management and security of the institution and/or pose a risk to other inmates in the institution.",,,,,
"Following up, Nancy Ayers, a spokeswoman for the Bureau of Prisoners, said the new policy views the needs of all federal prisoners and articulates the balance of safety needs of transgender inmates as well as other inmates.",,,,,
The statistics for sexual assault in prisons and jails are dismal.,,,,,
A study conducted by the Bureau of Justice Statistics shows 4% of federal and state prison inmates have been assaulted by either fellow inmates or by staff.,,,,,
2% of local jail inmates have suffered a similar fate.,,,,,
"The numbers for transgender inmates are far worse, by a factor of up to seven.",,,,,
This study was carried out when transgender prisoners were housed as they requested.,,,,,
"Obviously, this particular construct did not eliminate the threat from predators.",,,,,
"For their own safety, transgender as well as homosexual prisoners are sometimes placed in administrative segregation or protective custody.",,,,,
Biases among prison officials and a misperception among many guards about sexual orientation and/or identification mean access to such custody is not always easy or available.,,,,,
"Another problem is that protective and disciplinary custody are often the same, which means that prisoners in protective housing are often held with the most violent inmates in highly restrictive and isolated settings, sometimes in more or less permanent lockdown or solitary confinement.",,,,,
"However, when someone breaches the social contract and is subsequently imprisoned, they forfeit some of their rights as citizens.",,,,,
They no longer have the right of freedom of movement.,,,,,
They no longer have the right to be perilous to free society.,,,,,
They no longer have the right to follow their own agenda.,,,,,
They no longer have the right to demand where to be housed.,,,,,
"For the greater good and safety of the majority of prisoners, it is untenable to retain male prisoners who claim to be transgender within women's correctional facilities.",,,,,
The same is true for transgender females who want to be incarcerated in men's prisons.,,,,,
The potential for abuse is simply too high.,,,,,
"The Transgender Prison Blues Existing separation practices can improve prison safety By David H. Landon In our multi-cultural, gender-altering society, it's somewhat surprising that the issue of this week's debate would cause the angst that it apparently has stirred up.",,,,,
"The question: where should a transgender prisoner be housed; with their biological matching comrades-in-crime, or with the prisoners with whom they gender identify?",,,,,
We will start from the premise that everyone should have the right to be safe from both physical and psychological harm while incarcerated.,,,,,
Prisons should serve both as a deterrent for law breakers and as well as a place for rehabilitation so those released back into society have a chance to become law abiding taxpayers.,,,,,
"If they are traumatized by having been sexually abused while in prison, there is little chance for rehabilitation.",,,,,
"We know that under the best of prison conditions, that prison life is hard and fraught with conflicts amongst the population.",,,,,
"However, the fact that one is in prison must not divest one of basic human rights.",,,,,
Are transgenders more vulnerable to attacks while incarcerated?,,,,,
There is statistical evidence that suggests that transgender women (biological males transitioning into females) face increased threats of violence while incarcerated.,,,,,
"According to one survey conducted by the Transgender Law Center, 67% of transgender prisoners in the California correctional system report to having being assaulted while in men's prison.",,,,,
The vulnerability of LGBT prisoners has led some prisons to separate them from other prisoners.,,,,,
However in most prisons they are housed with the general population.,,,,,
"Statistically, these inmates are more likely to be assaulted both physically and sexually.",,,,,
They are more likely to be forced into prostitution when living in a male prison population.,,,,,
Prison protocol for assigning one to prison for many years was based upon the inmate's biological gender.,,,,,
If you had a man's genitals you were assigned to a men's prison.,,,,,
"If you shared the biological genitals of a woman, then it was a woman's prison for you.",,,,,
This was the case no matter how the prisoner self-identified.,,,,,
"That policy was changed by President Obama in the last days of his administration, when prison administrations were ordered to allow transgender women to be placed in women's prisons.",,,,,
That fix was not a hit in at least some of the women's prisons where women inmates were not happy about being housed in a prison with biological men no matter how they choose to identify themselves.,,,,,
"In fact, four women being held at a Texas detention center are not at all happy with that Obama policy.",,,,,
"They have filed a federal lawsuit arguing that the Obama decision is dangerous to them, leaving them at greater risk of rape if they are forced to share facilities with transgender women.",,,,,
When Donald Trump took office he reversed the Obama policy.,,,,,
The U.S. Bureau of Prisons announced a new policy stating that an inmate's biological sex will now be used to determine where transgender prisoners are housed.,,,,,
This new policy has angered the LGBT community.,,,,,
The classic problem here is the rights of one group (transgender inmates) coming directly into conflict with the rights of a second group (women inmates).,,,,,
"Expressing the opinion that as a woman, living in a cell block with a biological man makes them fearful for their safety, does not make them unreasonable or unsympathetic.",,,,,
Both groups of inmates want to feel safe during their prison stay.,,,,,
"While they may be in transition from being a man to becoming a woman, until they undergo surgical modification, transgender women are seen, rightly or wrongly it doesn.t matter, as a threat by some women.",,,,,
"Despite the all-inclusive message of the Netflix series Orange is the New Black to the contrary, transgender women in prison are perceived as threats to non-trans women.",,,,,
"Frankly, the civil rights of one group should not override the civil rights of another group.",,,,,
There is a compromise that should be able to work without affecting the rights of either group.,,,,,
Throughout the prison system there are populations of segregated prisoners within the same institution.,,,,,
"Prison officials, for the most part, manage to keep rival prison gangs separated within each prison.",,,,,
That's not to say that there aren't times when the rival gangs find ways to mix it up.,,,,,
Segregating them in different prison blocks keeps the violence to a minimum.,,,,,
"If prison authority can segregate these violent gangs, then they should be required to protect transgender women by segregating them within men's prisons.",,,,,
"It's not a perfect solution, but it addresses the violence against this population without endangering and violating the rights of others.",,,,,
Preserving dignity and safety Are our emotions overriding the facts?,,,,,
"If you are not transgender, you have as little to offer on what it's like to be transgender as I do.",,,,,
"Also, I am neither a doctor nor a psychologist.",,,,,
"If you aren't either, then we are equally unqualified to make factual assertions about the transgender paradigm.",,,,,
"Therefore, moving forward as empathetic and moral human beings, it is critical that those of us in those categories make the following concession: When it comes to trans issues, we are not born knowing or understanding them, and our average daily existence doesn't provide the necessary experience for us to know what the f**k we're talking about.",,,,,
"If you can't admit that, you have a perversely vainglorious sense of your cosmic value relative to your fellow beings.",,,,,
This understanding is critically important when we talk about putting people in prison.,,,,,
Our current administration's decision to void provisions for members of the transgendered community to be housed in a facility that corresponds to their current gender identification is not some form of tough but fair administrative judgment call.,,,,,
"It's a conscious choice not to care about the flagrantly available statistics, modern scientific thought, and reality in general.",,,,,
"I am willing to grant that their consistency is remarkable, but I can go no further with them.",,,,,
The balance of punishment with respect for human dignity is the difference between a just society and one that is itself criminal.,,,,,
"We do not become dollar bills behind bars, whose only distinguishing characteristic is a serial number.",,,,,
So here are the facts that the current administration doesn.t care about: medical and psychological science views transgenderism as a real condition that is of foundational importance to a person's identity and dignity.,,,,,
"The ability to provide services for the transgender community offers an overwhelming benefit for their quality of life, and one that is uniquely personal.",,,,,
"In other words, this is about who I am,not who I like to pretend to be.",,,,,
"Furthermore, the facts of life in prison for someone who is transgender are far more bleak than the average inmate's.",,,,,
"If you are using hormone replacement therapy and living as your non-biological gender, it is an interruption of the continuity of your humanity to be told you are going to have to get by without it because you are in prison.",,,,,
"There is no condition in which a non-transgendered man or woman would be told that, for their stay in Club Fed, they are going to have to be a different gender.",,,,,
"It's laughable to be sure, but only because it's so unthinkably outrageous.",,,,,
"Similarly, we would never tell a person that a stay in prison was going to delay splinting a broken arm or cost them access to insulin, and we can come to this conclusion with the most placid simplicity of thought.",,,,,
Transgendered people also face extremely high rates of sexual abuse in prison relative to the rest of the population.,,,,,
The following example provides anyone with a reasonable mind enough to know what it might be like: current policy provides that a person born as a man but living and grooming themselves as a woman who has breast implants would be housed in the general population of a male prison with a cellmate.,,,,,
This is not a hypothetical I've concocted for the sake of this debate.,,,,,
There was a headline-making case about a transgendered inmate this very month in a Colorado men's prison.,,,,,
The prison experience made Andy Dufresne's first year in Shawshank look like Megan and Prince Harry's wedding album.,,,,,
"After several rapes and beatings, the final sexual assault left her in the infirmary hours after a judge denied her request to be transferred to a safer situation.",,,,,
"In all cases, the facts on the outcome of these situations are clear.",,,,,
"Transgendered inmates, whether in male or female facilities, are overwhelmingly on the abused side of the equation.",,,,,
Men living as women do not show up in female prison facilities and take over the place as if Roger Federer took a lap on the WTA tour.,,,,,
They serve out their time in as much faceless obscurity as they can muster given their circumstances.,,,,,
"The cost to our prison facilities is minimal, as are the arrangements necessary for accommodating clothing such as bras, sanitary products and any treatment continuity that predates incarceration.",,,,,
We must be careful in a democracy as polarized as ours is these days that we don't allow our imagination and emotions to override the facts.,,,,,
"We can preserve the dignity and safety of transgender inmates, and it is our responsibility as a people who believe in the rule of law and value of our common humanity.",,,,,
"Equality for all  Transgender prisoners have rights, too  By Patrick Bittner In an age marred by very real fears of violence and hate, the idea that someone should be treated with respect and dignity is becoming somewhat of a radical, fringe idea.",,,,,
"Progress, it seems, has become either an antiquated notion or a dirty word, associated with weakness and un-American thinking.",,,,,
"To be equal no longer means regardless of our differences but rather to be forced into the mold of the angry, white, straight, and currently-in-power minority.",,,,,
"And while we can debate the role of the government in defining what is right, we cannot discount the role of that body to enforce and promote equality among its citizenry.",,,,,
"But what the shaved head-bearing, gun-toting, loud-mouthed members of middle America seem to forget is that equality does not mean everyone is the same as you.",,,,,
It means that everyone is given the same chance and treatment in life.,,,,,
This is no different when considering the question of incarceration.,,,,,
Prisoners are allotted rights that do not infringe on their basic human condition and guarantee them the same conditions and treatment as every other inmate regardless of any conditions.,,,,,
The rollback of these rules blatantly breaks this notion and creates a culture of uncertainty that can be taken advantage of on every level of both the criminal justice system and the underground prison society and leave the most vulnerable inmates defenseless.,,,,,
"While many may argue that the moment an individual breaks the law they are sacrificing their rights, this is simply not true.",,,,,
"According to Cornell Law School, Federal and state laws govern the establishment and administration of prisons as well as the rights of the inmates.",,,,,
"Although prisoners do not have full constitutional rights, they are protected by the Eighth Amendment's prohibition against cruel and unusual punishment.",,,,,
This protection also requires that prisoners be afforded a minimum standard of living.,,,,,
"Regardless, prisoners retain some constitutional rights, such as due process in their right to administrative appeals and a right of access to the parole process.",,,,,
"Additionally, the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment applies to prison inmates, protecting them against unequal treatment on the basis of race, sex, and creed, and the Model Sentencing and Correction Act, created by the Uniform Law Commission in 1978, provides that a confined person has a protected interest in freedom from discrimination on the basis of race, religion, national origin, or sexual orientation.",,,,,
"Put shortly, it is against the Constitution to provide one prisoner with a different condition than that of a comparable prisoner.",,,,,
"To place an individual, a person (and we must remember that just because someone is incarcerated does not mean they are no longer a person), in conditions that are against their identified gender directly contradicts the principles of the Constitution of the United States.",,,,,
"Not only is the refusal to treat transgender prisoners in a respectful and acceptable way illegal, it is dangerous.",,,,,
"As the National Center for Transgender Equality puts it, Trans people are also at high risk for abuse in prisons, jails, and juvenile detention.",,,,,
"The categorical denial of transition-related medical care is common, as is prolonged isolation of trans people, which has been shown to have devastating effects on mental health and has been declared by the courts to be a type of torture.",,,,,
Even more disturbing are some numbers about trans incarceration.,,,,,
"According to the New York Anti-Violence Project, 16% of the transgender and gender non-conforming people have been sent to jail or prison for any reason versus just 2.",,,,,
"Seven percent were arrested or held in a cell solely due to anti-transgender bias of police officers, 16% of those who had been incarcerated were physically assaulted by inmates or staff, and some 15% report having been sexually assaulted by inmates or staff while incarcerated.",,,,,
"Not only are these individuals jailed at a substantially higher rate than the general population, but they are at a higher risk of violent or sexual abuse during their incarceration.",,,,,
"To be blunt, all evidence points to this very specific segment of the prison population needing very specific regulations and often, protections.",,,,,
"Removing the protections put in place by the Obama Administration does not save money, does not reduce violence, does not remove an infringement on rights, and definitely does not make it easier for the prison system to function.",,,,,
"In short, it does two things, adds to the list of Obama-era rules that the current administration has undone, and takes away explicit rights and protections for a group of people that are not straight, white, or average.",,,,,
The animosity that an act such as removing these protections comes with is beyond comparison and those who support it need to re-evaluate their ethics and morals.,,,,,
"Every man, woman, child, and everything in between in this county is guaranteed fair treatment by everyone, including the prison system, and to remove protections that enforce that shows the type of America that we are currently living in.",,,,,
"If you want to do something about this, donate to the ACLU or even better, get out and vote and let's ensure a future where all people are protected from abuse regardless of gender identity.",,,,,
Albertans have a new option when in comes to identifying their gender on provincial documents and identification.,,,,,
"An X has been added to the gender choices of M and F , male or female, onÊdriver's licences, identification cards and vital statistics records such as birth and death certificates.",,,,,
"Premier Rachel Notley was on hand for Friday's announcement at the Strathcona Registry, which was decked out in rainbow colours for the event.",,,,,
"""We look forward to being able to work with Albertans to have their ID reflect their own sense of who they are"".",,,,,
The new gender option is available for AlbertansÊof all ages.,,,,,
"Adults can simply request a change, while youths aged 12 to 18 can have their gender identifier changed as long as they haveÊparental consent.",,,,,
"For children under age 12, the X option is also available.",,,,,
"Parents choose it on their child's behalf; in these cases, the application requires a supporting letter from a medical professional, says a government spokesperson.",,,,,
Someone who is described in their performance evaluations as analytical or someone who is described as compassionate?,,,,,
"On the other end of the employment spectrum, if you're downsizing and have to fire someone and the two people in jeopardy are very similar, who are you going to fire?",,,,,
Someone perceived as arrogant or someone perceived as inept?,,,,,
Leadership attributions in performance evaluations are powerful.,,,,,
"A unique and fascinating data set allowed us to explore the language used to describe individuals in subjective performance evaluations and provides evidence that, as we suspected, language in performance evaluations is applied differently to describe men and women.",,,,,
"We analyzed a large-scale military dataset (over 4,000 participants and 81,000 evaluations) to examine objective and subjective performance measures that included a list of 89 positive and negative leadership attributes that were used to assess leader performance in a military leadership setting.",,,,,
"The military provides an interesting and significant setting to evaluate gender bias as it is a long-standing and traditionally male profession that has, over several decades, worked to eliminate formal gender segregation and discrimination.",,,,,
"For performance evaluations specifically, the military has long been predicated on meritocratic ideals of fairness and justice providing equal opportunity regardless of demographics.",,,,,
"The top-down enforcement of equal employment opportunity policies, hierarchical organization by military rank and not social status characteristics, and recent total gender integration in all occupations are hallmarks of meritocratic organizations where we might expect less gender bias in performance evaluations.",,,,,
"However, the subjective evaluations provided a wealth of interesting findings.",,,,,
"For starters, in terms of sheer numbers of attributes, we found no gender difference in the number of positive attributes assigned, but women were assigned significantly more negative attributes.",,,,,
We also looked at which specific attributes were more often assigned to men and to women.,,,,,
This gives us a better idea of how gendered language is employed in leader evaluations.,,,,,
"The most commonly used positive term to describe men was analytical, while for women it was compassionate.",,,,,
"At the other extreme, the most commonly used negative term to describe men was arrogant.",,,,,
We found statistically significant gender differences in how often these terms (and others) were used (relative to the other positive or negative terms available for selection) when describing men and women even though men's and women's performances were the same by more objective measures.,,,,,
Both analytical and compassionate reflect positively on the individual being evaluated.,,,,,
"However, could one characterization be more valuable from an organizational standpoint?",,,,,
"The term analytical is task-oriented, speaking to an individual's ability to reason, to interpret, to strategize, and lending support to the objectives or mission of the business.",,,,,
"Compassion is relationship-oriented, contributing to a positive work environment and culture, but perhaps of less value to accomplishing the work at hand.",,,,,
"When considering who to hire, who to promote, or who to compensate, which person with which attribute takes the prize?",,,,,
"Likewise, who is retained and who is fired?",,,,,
An arrogant employee may have a character flaw and a negative impact on his work environment but may still be able to accomplish the task or job.,,,,,
"An inept person, in contrast, is clearly not qualified and presumably on her way out.",,,,,
Our research on leadership attributes found significant differences in the assignment of 28 leadership attributes when applied to men and women.,,,,,
"While men were more often assigned attributes such as analytical, competent, athletic and dependable, women were more often assigned compassionate, enthusiastic, energetic and organized.",,,,,
"Consistent with our results, societal attitudes suggest that women leaders are described as more compassionate (the most assigned attribute overall) and organized than men leaders.",,,,,
"In contrast, women were more often evaluated as inept, frivolous, gossip, excitable, scattered, temperamental, panicky, and indecisive, while men were more often evaluated as arrogant and irresponsible.",,,,,
These are not just words they can have real-life implications for employees and organizations.,,,,,
Language in performance evaluations can tell us what is valued and what is not in an organization.,,,,,
Employees also know what is valued and make choices and decisions about how well they fit in an organization and their potential to advance.,,,,,
Our research is in line with other studies that have found differences in formal feedback for men and women.,,,,,
"Some studies have shown that women are more likely to receive vague feedback that is not connected to objectives or business outcomes, which is a disadvantage when women are competing for job opportunities, promotions, and rewards, and in terms of women's professional growth and identity.",,,,,
"Women leaders often get conflicting feedback told on the one hand that they're too bossy or aggressive, but on the other that they should be more confident and assertive.",,,,,
"A huge body of work has found that when women are collaborative and communal, they are not perceived as competent but when they emphasize their competence, they're seen as cold and unlikable, in a classic double bind.",,,,,
"One of the things that's ironic about our findings is that many of the leadership traits that people say they most appreciate, want in a leader, or make a successful leader are the positive traits such as compassion that women leaders receive in their performance evaluations.",,,,,
So why isn't this translating into more women in these roles?,,,,,
"It's one thing to describe an ideal leader, it's another to describe a real person's performance without being influenced by stereotypes about their gender, or stereotypes about what a leader should be.",,,,,
"Because of widely held societal beliefs about gender roles and leadership, when most people are asked to picture a leader, what they picture is a male leader.",,,,,
"Even when women and men behave in leaderly ways among peers speaking up with new ideas, for example it's men who are seen as leaders by the group, not women.",,,,,
"As our study shows, even in this era of talent management and diversity and inclusion initiatives, our formal feedback mechanisms are still suffering from the same biases, sending subtle messages to women that they aren't real leaders men are.",,,,,
"Even when they have Harvard MBAs, black women are generally absent in leadership positions at most Fortune 500 companies, and black men are in high-ranking roles in only a handful.",,,,,
Researchers who have examined black women in corporate settings generally highlight their unique experiences not just as black workers but as black women workers.,,,,,
"Dealing with racism and sexism means that black women in these settings face particular challenges at work, from difficulty finding mentors and sponsors to extra scrutiny of their hair and other aspects of their appearance.",,,,,
These are important findings that give some insight into how race and gender operate together to yield specific outcomes for black women.,,,,,
But they only reveal part of the picture for black workers.,,,,,
"Black men, of course, are also present in professional work.",,,,,
How are their experiences in these settings driven by race and gender and how do they differ from the experiences black men have in other types of occupations?,,,,,
"In white maleÐdominated professions like law, engineering, or medicine, black men are in the majority because of their gender, but in the minority due to their race.",,,,,
"Consequently, they occupy a somewhat contradictory position where they simultaneously fit in even while they stand out.",,,,,
It's not quite the token experience that Rosabeth Moss Kanter describes in her classic study of women working in male-dominated spaces.,,,,,
"Those women, mostly white, were constantly reminded of the ways they stood out, faced a paradox of visibility and invisibility, and were relegated to gender-typed positions as secretaries or wives even when they were high-ranking executives.",,,,,
Black men's experiences in these types of environments are a bit more complicated.,,,,,
Two of my recent research studies touch on the ways that black professional men navigate predominantly white work settings.,,,,,
"In one, I conducted intensive interviews with 42 black men working in high-status occupations doctors, lawyers, engineers, and bankers.",,,,,
I found that these men's relationships with other men in their workplaces were informed by gender and race in unique ways.,,,,,
"For one thing, most of my respondents described largely amiable relationships with their white male coworkers.",,,,,
"Unlike women of all races, who have to walk a fine line in male-dominated professions Ñ for example, being friendly without seeming sexual, being assertive without coming across as aggressive black men could fairly easily capitalize on culturally masculinized interests and activities to forge a bond with their white male colleagues.",,,,,
"Jason, an engineer, told me: One of my friendships [with a supervisor] was established through working out. We work out every morning, and we talk every morning and have coffee together in the morning. I think [that's one of] the advantages men have, just working outÓ.",,,,,
"This experience reflects research from sociologist Catherine Turco, who shows that for black men in the leveraged buyout industry in particular, sportsÊare a key way to bond with white men in ways that are often unavailable to women.",,,,,
"For many black men in these settings, gender is something they are able to capitalize on so that white men can become friends, colleagues, and peers.",,,,,
"As Max, an engineer, put it, If youÕre male and African American, you don't have the double bias [that women face].",,,,,
"You're a minority, but you can befriend the other male colleagues.",,,,,
"And maybe they won't like you, but there are enough senior male colleagues that one of them will like you, and you can get the information you need.",,,,,
"So it's much different for a femaleÉthan an African American male, because I'm a male, and a lot of the restrictions that male colleagues will put on their interactions with females in the department don't exist for me.",,,,,
But race matters for black men in these settings too.,,,,,
"While they can capitalize on shared gendered experiences to bond with white men, who can serve in important roles as allies, sponsors, and mentors, they describe a sense of alienation and isolation on the job.",,,,,
"This comes from the fact that fitting in with white colleagues has its limits, and from the sense that only other black men can really understand the challenges associated with being black and male in these spaces Ñ the persistent negative stereotyping, the complicated dance of managing interactions with white women to avoid appearing threatening, the need to avoid ever being perceived as the angry black man.",,,,,
"Yet with so few other black professional men being in these spaces, opportunities to bond and form allegiances are often infrequent.",,,,,
"And even in the rare cases when other black men work in the office, gendered conditioning tends to encourage men to be stoic and independent.",,,,,
This means that many black men don't feel equipped to reach out to other black men to develop meaningful friendships because that's what women do.,,,,,
"In the words of Jared, a lawyer, When it comes to women in a large law firm, I would imagine they would be closer.",,,,,
"Because I just feel like [with] men and the experiences that I've had with men in this profession, we're not really about all crying on each otherÕs shoulders.",,,,,
"Although we are here to help out if we can, or to bounce ideas off of, I don't know if we're necessarily as close as maybe women are.",,,,,
"Still, the types relationships that black men have with other men can be drastically different depending on their occupation.",,,,,
"In a forthcoming book on black workers in the health care industry, I show that while black men working in the male-dominated field of medicine find it much easier to connect with white colleagues, black men working in the female-dominated profession of nursing face extensive barriers in their attempts to forge ties with the white men they encounter at work.",,,,,
"They struggled to bond with white men, who rarely seemed interested in connecting and often stymied their efforts to advance.",,,,,
"As Curtis, an orthopedic nurse, told me, It's almost like you have to take your ideas and give them to somebody else, and let them present for you, and you get no credit for it.",,,,,
"Sociologist Christine Williams has shown that for white men, work in female-dominated professions can actually provide more opportunities for advancement.",,,,,
"Given that, it may be that whiteÊmale nurses try to maintain their racial and gendered advantages, and actively exclude black men from opportunities to advance.",,,,,
"If so, this opportunity hoarding is compounded by the fact that black male nurses rarely encountered other black male colleagues who might sympathize, making the sense of isolation even more acute.",,,,,
"Here, race and gender created experiences among black men that are more akin to the chilly climate that many women experience in STEM fields as they confront harassment and hostility from colleagues that leads to systemic disadvantage.",,,,,
"Because working in the female-dominated profession of nursing left black men in the minority due to both their race and gender, it may have created workplaces where they saw fewer allies and pathways to advancement than their counterparts in male-dominated fields.",,,,,
"Taken together, the experiences of black men in different occupations shows that context matters.",,,,,
"In many ways, they are Òoutsiders withinÓ in corporate America, and the particulars reflect their unique position of race and gender.",,,,,
"This leaves them with workplace relationships and general experiences that differ starkly from those of other numerical minorities, particularly women, but also from black men in female-dominated professions.",,,,,
"Because of this, it's important for managers to be mindful of the ways that black professionals work experiences can vary widely, and that one-size-fits-all attempts to increase workplace diversity and to reduce racial tensions may be met with limited success.",,,,,
Many of her girlfriends worked toward the same goal.,,,,,
But her younger brother and most of her male friends seemed more inclined to act like Falstaff than to study Shakespeare.,,,,,
"""A lot of guys thought studying was for girls,"" says DeLong, now a junior French major at the University of Georgia in Athens.",,,,,
"""They were really intelligent, but they would goof off, and it seemed to be accepted by the teachers"".",,,,,
"Take DeLong's experience, multiply it a few thousand times in schools across the state, and it isn't surprising that at her campus this year, the freshman class is nearly 61% female.",,,,,
"In a freshman English tutorial, small clusters of men sit quietly as women dominate class discussions.",,,,,
"But outside class, the mood on campus is distinctly male friendly.",,,,,
"Tyler Willingham, social chair of the Sigma Nu fraternity, observes that at parties, even guys without dates can choose from ""many beautiful women"".",,,,,
This sort of gender gap is glaring and growing at campuses across America.,,,,,
"Until 1979, men made up the majority of college students.",,,,,
"As women won increasing equality elsewhere in society, it was natural and expected that they would reach parity in college, which they did by the early 1980s.",,,,,
But the surprise has been that men's enrollment in higher education has declined since 1992.,,,,,
Males now make up just 44% of undergraduate students nationwide.,,,,,
And federal projections show their share shrinking to as little as 42% by 2010.,,,,,
This trend is among the hottest topics of debate among college-admissions officers.,,,,,
And some private liberal arts colleges have quietly begun special efforts to recruit men Ñ including admissions preferences for them.,,,,,
"There are few hard facts, but lots of theories.",,,,,
Anecdotal evidence suggests that more men than women respond to the lure of high-tech jobs that don't require a bachelor's degree.,,,,,
"Some call this the Bill Gates syndrome, after the college-dropout chairman of Microsoft.",,,,,
But high-tech industries employ only about 9% of the U.S. work force.,,,,,
"Amid the hot economy of recent years, a larger group of men especially those from lower-income families might be heading straight from high school into fields like aircraft mechanics and telephone- and power-line repair that pay an average of $850 a week rather than taking on a load of college debt.",,,,,
"Some social critics blame a dearth of male role models among schoolteachers, and a culture that promotes anti-intellectualism among boys.",,,,,
"And, especially in inner cities, crime and gangs entice more boys than girls away from learning.",,,,,
How pervasive is the gender gap?,,,,,
"According to Thomas Mortenson, an education analyst in Oskaloosa, Iowa, the share of college degrees earned by males has been declining for decades.",,,,,
"U.S. government figures show that from 1970 to 1996, as the number of bachelor's degrees earned by women increased 77%, the number earned by men rose 19%.",,,,,
Not all schools are feeling the imbalance; many Žlite colleges and universities have seen applications soar from both sexes.,,,,,
"But the overall numbers, says Mortenson, should make us ""wake up and see that boys are in trouble"".",,,,,
"Jacqueline King, author of a recent study on the gender gap in college, emphasizes that it is widest among blacks (63% women to 37% men in the latest figures), Hispanics (57% to 43%) and, in her analysis, lower-income whites (54% to 46%).",,,,,
"""It's not middle-class white young men who aren't going to college,"" she says.",,,,,
And an enrollment boom among older women is further skewing the numbers.,,,,,
"Mortenson, though, cites U.S. Census measures indicating that the gap cuts across racial and income groups.",,,,,
"Moreover, he and others argue, boys as a group trail girls at many stages of K-12 achievement: boys tend to earn lower grades and are less likely to earn a high school diploma.",,,,,
"They score marginally higher on the SAT, but only 65% of boys who apply are admitted to college, vs. 69% of girls.",,,,,
"Christina Hoff Sommers, a conservative education analyst, writes in her recent book, The War Against Boys, that schoolboys are ""routinely regarded as protosexists, potential harassers and perpetuators of gender inequity"" who ""live under a cloud of censure"".",,,,,
"Sommers cites studies showing that boys come to school less prepared than girls, do less homework and get suspended more often.",,,,,
"""For males, there's no social currency in being a straight-A student,"" says Clifford Thornton, associate dean of admissions at Wesleyan University.",,,,,
"Although the latest figures show that college graduates earn, on average, almost double the wages of those with no college, ""there's a sense among many boys that it's sissy to go to college,"" says sociologist and author Michael Kimmel.",,,,,
"After high school he took classes at a community college before quitting to work in his father's cabinet shop in Royston, Ga.",,,,,
"Today Spagnoli, 25, earns $50,000 a year, while his buddies are just finishing college, taking jobs for lower pay.",,,,,
"""You don't need a degree"" he says, if you have a talent.",,,,,
Some private liberal arts colleges are making it easier for men to get in.,,,,,
"This year's freshman class is 43% male up from 36% last year in part because the school gave preference to ""qualified male candidates on the margin,"" says Robert Massa, vice president for enrollment and student life.",,,,,
The idea gets mixed reviews among Dickinson's students.,,,,,
"""It reeks of affirmative action,"" says physics major Michelle Edwards.",,,,,
"But Massa emphasizes that ""the men we admitted were as qualified as the women"".",,,,,
Last July the University of Georgia lost a lawsuit filed by female students who were denied admission because of an affirmative-action policy that favored men.,,,,,
"Says junior Shanna Norris, 20: ""It's not fair that a boy would get extra weight (in the admissions index) over a girl, but it would be better if there were more boys on campus"".",,,,,
How then to recruit more guys?,,,,,
"At the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, recruiters aggressively tout math and science programs traditionally popular among male applicants.",,,,,
Chicago's DePaul University (59% female) sends out extra mailings to boys.,,,,,
"Public universities, though, could face legal challenges if they were to try recruiting more males.",,,,,
In California a strict anti-affirmative-action statute effectively precludes gender-based outreach.,,,,,
In Texas and Florida both of which have largely abolished preferences in admissions policies state officials say there are no special plans to lure more men.,,,,,
Many schools still try to balance programs historically dominated by one gender (like engineering and social work) by offering slots to underrepresented students.,,,,,
"But that doesn't necessarily boost, say, the number of Hispanic males.",,,,,
And that has led some educators to skirt the recruiting rules.,,,,,
"At San Francisco State University, Roberto Haro, a professor of ethnic studies, routinely recruits minority males at Boys Clubs and middle schools in inner-city areas.",,,,,
"As a result, he says, ""in the past year, we've seen a slight increase in the number of minority males who have applied"".",,,,,
Black fraternities are also getting involved.,,,,,
"In Maryland the Howard County alumni chapter of Alpha Phi Alpha runs a mentoring program for high school males, helping boost their grades and inspiring them to apply to college.",,,,,
"Says program head David Barrett: ""So many of our boys are in prison.",,,,,
The ones in school they're under tremendous pressure from their peers not to excel academically.,,,,,
"""Eventually,"" he says, ""men will start going back to college to meet the demand for an educated labor force"".",,,,,
"And surely more men will also be lured onto campuses by the realization that they'll be surrounded by smart, attractive women with great earnings prospects.",,,,,
"Jo Swinson is a British member of parliament, deputy Leader of the Liberal Democrats and author of Equal Power.",,,,,
"The new Spanish Prime Minister, Pedro Sanchez, has shown leaders around the world something simple, but striking: you can have more women than men in your cabinet without the country falling apart.",,,,,
"What is even more remarkable is that so many of the biggest jobs in the Spanish cabinet, including economy, defense, finance and education, went to women.",,,,,
"As a member of parliament (MP) in the U.K., a country where we are yet to have a woman serve as head of the treasury or defense secretary, I applaud Mr Sanchez.",,,,,
"As a seasoned campaigner for gender-balanced representation in both the U.K. and Scottish Parliaments, I am delighted with this news as I was also in 2014 when Nicola Sturgeon, Scotland's First Minister, appointed a gender-balanced Cabinet, three years ago when Canada's Prime Minister Justin Trudeau announced his gender-balanced top team (because it's 2015) and last year when President Emmanuel Macron of France did the same.",,,,,
We need more leaders to follow their example.,,,,,
"It will show to the rest that women can fit comfortably into any environment, that all the good women haven't been snapped up, that women can handle the pressure.",,,,,
These were just some of the pathetic excuses given by FTSE 350 businesses to a government-backed review to explain why they didn't have more women on their boards.,,,,,
"But, part of me also wishes that we lived in a world where appointing as many or more women to a government was the norm, not the news.",,,,,
The sad truth is that it simply isn't.,,,,,
Let's take the U.K. as an example.,,,,,
It wasn't until 2017 that the total number of women MPs ever elected to the House of Commons finally overtook the number of men currently serving as MPs.,,,,,
"In local government, just a third of councillors in England are women, with even fewer in Wales (28%) and Scotland (24%).",,,,,
"In the U.S., Donald Trump's current cabinet women hold six of the 23 positions.",,,,,
So what's stopping there being more women at the top?,,,,,
"The most commonly cited barriers are known as the four Cs: cash, caring, confidence and culture.",,,,,
"A decade ago, estimates put the cost of a winning candidacy, including lost earnings, at over £40,000.",,,,,
"This affects men as well as women, but when men earn 19% more than women on average in the U.K., the financial barrier to politics is even higher for women.",,,,,
"There is also the question of family commitments, and balancing care with the demands of politics.",,,,,
"Across society, the lion's share of caring responsibility whether for children or elderly relatives still falls on women.",,,,,
"The pattern among colleagues in my party is that women were typically either elected young, like myself, with no children, or when their children were teenagers or had left home.",,,,,
"This was not the case for men, many of whom were first elected when their children were very young.",,,,,
"In the current political system, in the U.K. and U.S., you have to put your head above the parapet and be prepared to make your point forcefully.",,,,,
You need the confidence to say ÒIÕm the best person for this.,,,,,
We often tell women and girls it is not OK to blow their own trumpet in that way.,,,,,
As a society we still tell girls how to be feminine and ladylike.,,,,,
These traits do not help you get to the top jobs in the current environment.,,,,,
"Male-dominated workplaces, including the top levels of politics in much of the Western world, makes women feel uncomfortable in other ways too.",,,,,
"This is something the #MeToo movement highlighted, including in the U.K. parliament and among lawmakers in the U.S. While my party was in government, one ministerial colleague told me she would always ensure she was seated on the opposite side of the table when having a meeting with a particularly tactile minister.",,,,,
"Much of political decision-making concentrates power in the hands of those already inside the circle, who tend to be men.",,,,,
"Excluding women may not be the intention, but when they are not invited into the room where decisions are made, you can see how it happens.",,,,,
That is why it is so important that men who have the opportunity to open these doors to more women take it.,,,,,
"Even in places where female representation is more balanced, there are still parts of power closed to women.",,,,,
"One example I heard was from Finland, where the current cabinet is 41% women (in 2015 the split stood at 62% women).",,,,,
Former Finnish parliamentarian Johanna Sumuvuori told me the Finnish Parliament has separate saunas for male and female MPs and staff.,,,,,
"Johanna explained how her male colleagues on the Finance Committee would joke that they'd already made all the decisions in the men's sauna before they arrived to the meeting, dubbed the Sauna Committee.",,,,,
"Getting more women into positions of power will change this, and make governments more representative of the populations they serve.",,,,,
"But if, like me, you want us to move faster toward gender-balanced governments and parliaments, here are three simple things you can do.",,,,,
"Notice the number of men and women standing as candidates, becoming elected representatives, speaking at events, the split of journalist bylines in newspapers and challenge parties, organizers or media outlets when they are not representative.",,,,,
"Second, talent-spot our next women politicians.",,,,,
There are campaigns across the globe to help more women get into politics.,,,,,
"In the U.K., there's the #AskHerToStand campaign, and in the U.S. there's She Should Run; both offer advice to potential candidates and how you can encourage women you know friends, family and colleagues to consider standing for election.",,,,,
"And third, write to or go to see your elected representative.",,,,,
Ask them what they are doing to make politics more representative.,,,,,
"When politicians get even just a dozen letters about an issue, trust me, they notice.",,,,,
We certainly need more politicians like Sanchez leading by example.,,,,,
"But unless we see more systemic change, I worry that in a decade's time we'll still have news reports on the gender makeup of a new government.",,,,,
"IDEAS TIME Ideas hosts the world's leading voices, providing commentary on events in news, society, and culture.",,,,,
We welcome outside contributions.,,,,,
Opinions expressed do not necessarily reflect the views of TIME editors.,,,,,
"The rom-com lover in me wishes desperately that they did, but alas.",,,,,
"Just as we don't live in a world where JLo is believable as a dog walker, we also don't live in a world where approaching a stranger in the produce section is romantic.",,,,,
So how are you even supposed to meet people?,,,,,
That's the answer that no one seems to want to hear.,,,,,
People in movies hit on strangers in public places because they only have 90 minutes to live out a whole dramatic arc.,,,,,
No one wants to watch a couple meet multiple times and slowly realize that theyÕre more than friends.,,,,,
"In real life, hitting on strangers doesn't usually get you anywhere.",,,,,
That doesn't mean that you can never talk to a stranger again without an introductionÑthis isn't Regency-era England.,,,,,
You just have to be aware of the effect youÕre having.,,,,,
The golden rule of all attempted romantic encounters is: Take no for an answer.,,,,,
"Again, these places might seem ripe for meet-cutes in movies (the juxtaposition of romantic moment and unromantic location! ), but in the real world they're places where women are usually alone.",,,,,
"This dynamic probably makes you, the approacher, feel less threatened, but it makes her, the approached, feel like she's in the kitchen in Jurassic Park with velociraptors scraping at the door handles.",,,,,
"If she keeps going about her business even as you try to approach her, that's a great sign that (surprise! ) she is not interested.",,,,,
Let her carry on with her day.,,,,,
"Likewise, if she's giving you short, one-word answers and doesn't ask you any questions about yourself, that's also a pretty good sign that she's not interested.",,,,,
Say you're shopping at Pier One and you approach a nice-looking lady.,,,,,
"Say she plants her feet, stays in one spot, and seems genuinely riveted (not scared-riveted) by your commentary about how you simply donÕt ÒgetÓ throw pillows.",,,,,
"Sure, keep the conversation going, but if she keeps on walking, do not follow.",,,,,
Never follow a woman!,,,,,
"If you've left a woman without an easy escape from interacting with you, you're doing it wrong.",,,,,
"This is also why you should never, ever, ever hit on a woman while sheÕs at work.",,,,,
She's not interested in you she's doing her job.,,,,,
She's being paid to be nice to you.,,,,,
"At one time or another, we've all felt a connection with the Trader Joe's cashier who compliments us on our choice of turkey corn dogs, but they don't really care.",,,,,
They're being paid to make people feel like the grocery store is a nice place to be.,,,,,
Your hairdresser is also not hitting on you; she's trying to make sure her Yelp reviews don't dip.,,,,,
"I'm sure that hitting on someone in any of these scenarios probably seems harmless, a word men throw around with abandon. But it's not.",,,,,
It can actually be really scary for women.,,,,,
"If you approach me in the dentist's waiting room, I automatically assume you're a serial killer.",,,,,
"And putting aside the Bundy extreme, it's really annoying to have to pause your day so that a man you've never met can tell you that based on literally nothing but your appearance, he wants to get to know you.",,,,,
"If it would be annoying for a man to stop and talk to you, a man, during an activity, then don't do that to someone else.",,,,,
"There are, of course, places where it is much more appropriate to approach strangers.",,,,,
"To some extent, bars, concerts, sporting events, festivals, parties, weddings, and the like are places where being hit on while still not always welcome is expected.",,,,,
"Getting hit on in these venues and events is simultaneously more terrifying, because youÕre more likely to be drinking, and less terrifying, because I'm less likely to be there on my own.",,,,,
Women often use our friends as safety buddies when we go out.,,,,,
"I can almost guarantee that at one point or another, you've seen women go to the bathroom as a group in order to save one of their friends from a guy who won't leave her alone.",,,,,
"Not only are men less likely to do creepy shit in front of other people, but just having friends nearby in a bar gives women a slew of escape plans.",,,,,
"If a woman ever tells you that she has to go find her friend, let her go.",,,,,
"Again, do not follow her; do not offer to help her find her friend.",,,,,
"SheÕs not being ""forced"" to go back to her friends.",,,,,
"We have plenty of signals to let our lady friends know when we're having fun with a guy, or if we need help Irish-goodbyeing his ass.",,,,,
"If you're dancing with a girl and her friend keeps stepping in or grabbing her hand to pull her away, her friend is not cock-blocking you: Your dance partner has probably been trying to get away for a while.",,,,,
"And even without friend-assists, there are a lot of signs you can watch out for.",,,,,
"If a woman says she's going to the bathroom and she doesn't come back, don't circle the bar seeking her out.",,,,,
"And if you offer to buy a woman a drink at a bar and she says she isn't finished with her last one, that means ""no"".",,,,,
"Do not buy her a drink then, and certainly don't offer to buy the next one.",,,,,
"Lastly, if a woman says that she's tired, or that she thinks she's just going to head home, that is not an opportunity for you to invite yourself, or to beg her to stay out.",,,,,
"Women do give you clues, and often they're pretty clear.",,,,,
"While many men have good intentions when hitting on women, they often seem to misunderstand just how terrifying it can be to be approached by a stranger.",,,,,
A lot of men also underestimate just how many bad experiences most women have had turning men down.,,,,,
"It's not that we don't wish we could tell you all, straight-up, leave me alone or fuck off, Beyonce is playing right now and no man should be speaking until she's done.",,,,,
"We just know that if weÕre boring enough and keep giving one-word answers, you might think it was your idea to leave us alone, which is less likely to make you angry, aggressive, or even violent.",,,,,
"There's a pervasive myth that persistence is sexy, but it's really creepy.",,,,,
"I promise you that if you misread the signs and leave a conversation too early, a woman who is sincerely interested in you will just come find you across the bar.",,,,,
"In our humble opinion, you're never too old to break open a fresh box of Crayola crayons.",,,,,
"The iconic symbol of childhood will forever uphold a sense of timelessness, which in our world of fads and trends reigns elite.",,,,,
"Luckily, reconnecting with Crayola years later offers more than just doodling for a short-lived, nostalgic moment.",,,,,
"The beloved brand launched their own beauty collection exclusively at ASOS.com called Crayola Beauty, bringing crayons conveniently back into our everyday lives it's safe to say we are fangirling big-time.",,,,,
Bring on the crayon glam!,,,,,
"The line which dropped on Monday, June 4 stays true to Crayola's big box mentality with 95 vegan, cruelty-free shades.",,,,,
"Of course, we will find ourselves needing all 95 colors, just like we did in elementary school.",,,,,
"The 58-piece collection features whimsical, one-of-a-kind products that are sure to ignite a childish wonder and excitement you can choose from color-changing lipsticks, eye palettes, bright highlighters, bold mascaras, and an artist-like brush kit, just to name a few.",,,,,
Also note the vanity-worthy packaging.,,,,,
"Of course, we were curious to see if any of Crayola's products encouraged coloring outside the lines: introducing the face crayon.",,,,,
"Available in a plethora of eye-popping, mesmerizing colors (to say the least) this dreamy product is perfect for eyes, lips, and cheeks alike but not exclusively.",,,,,
"We can't applaud Crayola enough for staying true to their humble, affordable ways.",,,,,
Not only does the collection range in price from $15-$40 (amazing) but it is gender-fluid and promotes Òself-expression and personal creativity.,,,,,
That's one message we are proud to get behind.,,,,,
"Courtesy of Crayola and ASOS Getting ready in the morning has never felt more like playtime hopefully, this line brings some lightheartedness to your AM adulting routine.",,,,,
"Golfer Billy Horschel knows how to make a fashion statement, perhaps better than anyone else on the PGA Tour.",,,,,
"At the 2013 U.S. Open, Horschel got everyone's attention with theÊoctopus-printed pants he wore during the final round, and since then, he's continued to be one of the most fashion-forward golfers hitting the greens.",,,,,
So it's no surprise that Horschel has become the first-ever athlete to collaborate with Ralph Lauren on a clothing line.,,,,,
"The 2014 FedExCup winner is collaborating with the 50-year-old American brand on a capsule collection for men and women, the RLX x Billy Horschel Collection, which includes summer and fall lines of pants, knitwear, layering pieces, outerwear, polos, and shorts the latter inspired by Horschel's attention-grabbing octopus pants.",,,,,
"It's pretty humbling to be the first, especially when you look at the actors, celebrities, athletes, and other people who have worn Ralph Lauren over the years.",,,,,
"It's an honor to have my own line, and it was great to be a part of the process.",,,,,
"I've become someone on tour who is known for his fashion and gotten attention for it, and I it was exciting being part of the design process.",,,,,
"Men's Journal caught up with Horschel to speak about being the first-ever athlete collaborator with Ralph Lauren, how he trains, his favorite pieces from his new line, and why he picked Jay Z as his tee shot walk-up music.",,,,,
What does it mean to you to be the first-ever athlete to collaborate with Ralph Lauren?,,,,,
What was the process like?,,,,,
It's an honor to have my own line.,,,,,
"I've been part of the process a little bit, mostly with working with them on how the clothes fit, and with certain style and design ideas.",,,,,
"It was so exciting for me, being with it from beginning to end, helping select the colors to use, and style of pants that we wanted, the stripe patterns, and working on how the little details to certain shirts helped make them stand out a little more.",,,,,
"Obviously, everyone knows me for wearing some crazy pants, but I'm a really big proponent of the little things and how they can make things stand out a bit more.",,,,,
"To even think about that, that I'll have my own line with the logo on the back of the shirt, and people wearing stuff that I designed that's exciting.",,,,,
When will the line be available?,,,,,
When are you debuting the line on tour?,,,,,
"People can get it on July 15, it'll be at RalphLauren.com, the PGA Store website, and available at clubs around the country as well.",,,,,
I'll be debuting them at the PGA Championship in August.,,,,,
"I designed a five-piece line, so I'll wear something from Wednesday to hopefully Sunday.",,,,,
"I don't want to get ahead of things, but I've thought it would be really amazing to win the championship in my own clothes that I designed.",,,,,
What's the piece of the line you're most excited for people to see?,,,,,
"When I first wore the octopus pants at the 2013 U.S. Open, that kind of put me on the map with fashion, so we pay homage to that with the shorts.",,,,,
"I'm going to wear that version on Wednesday, since we're allowed to wear shorts for the PGA Championship practice round.",,,,,
"It has a little different color, but an updated version of the old style.",,,,,
"We also have a rain jacket, and you don't see this a lot in golf these days, we have a similar type of jacket, but short sleeved.",,,,,
It's a waterproof-type design and it's great to wear when it gets a bit nasty out there.,,,,,
"Without the long sleeves, you can stay a little cooler and swing a little easier.",,,,,
Courtesy of Ralph Lauren The PGA Tour gave players the chance to use walk-up music at the Zurich Classic of New Orleans which Horschel won along with partner Scott Piercy.,,,,,
How did you pick your walk-up music?,,,,,
"I picked Jay Z because my partner at the tournament, Scott Piercy, we're both Jay-Z fans, and that song Forever Young we both like the beat and the rhythm.",,,,,
"It's calming and pumps me up at the same time, and it was great to use when we were going to tee off.",,,,,
"I was going to suggest using Warren G, Regulate on Sunday, but we were playing so well all weekend I didn't want to change it up [laughs].",,,,,
"It's cool to see that the tour is having some fun, and kind of show that you can have fun out here and still be respectful to the game at the same time.",,,,,
"The majority of guys listen to music before a round of golf or when they're at home playing golf, so to have that on the first tee is fun and the fans enjoyed it.",,,,,
How Golfer Justin Thomas Overhauled His Training and Fueled a Breakout PGA Tour Season How important is stretching and flexibility to your game?,,,,,
How often do you use the Massage Envy Player Performance Center?,,,,,
"I have my own trainer and a physiotherapist, and we've worked on getting my body more flexible; I've leaned out a lot.",,,,,
"I do use the guys on the trailer once in a while, I'll sometimes get massages and get stretched out after rounds.",,,,,
"If there's a day I wake up and something feels off in my body, I'll go see the guys if my physio isn't on the road with me.",,,,,
It's vital now for guys.,,,,,
"I hired a physio a few years ago, and I've seen the added benefit, and you see a lot of guys doing that and getting worked on.",,,,,
"There's like 10 physios that travel now on tour, and of those guys, it's like 60 players out there that they treat.",,,,,
You're seeing a lot of guys hiring their own physios.,,,,,
"So people are embracing doing stuff in the gym correctly, but also embracing that recovery part as well.",,,,,
What do you love most about playing at the PLAYERS Championship?,,,,,
What's so great about that tournament?,,,,,
"Over my first two days at the PLAYERS Championship, I played really well for how bad I hit it [laughs].",,,,,
"I putted really well, and I missed it in the right spots.",,,,,
"Living here and playing this course a lot, I know where I can miss and still get up and down the hole, so that was helpful.",,,,,
I love being here.,,,,,
"The Ponte Vedra fans and Jacksonville fans are amazing and always come out here, and me living here for about nine years, they've been great to me.",,,,,
This place is great.,,,,,
"I love this event, it's the Tour, it's our tournament, I do think it's the fifth major when you think of how guys prepare for it, they really do take it seriously.",,,,,
"I say to people, you know it's a fifth major because our practice rounds take about three hours to play nine holes, and any other week it's less than that.",,,,,
"Guys here are hitting more chips and more putts on every hole, they're being more diligent about their practice.",,,,,
It's a great event and I love it.,,,,,
Does momentum and playing well in one tournament leading into the next carry over for you?,,,,,
For me it does.,,,,,
"If you look at the history of me on the PGA Tour, once I get some momentum building it continues for me for a while.",,,,,
"I can't say that's the case for everyone, but for me it is.",,,,,
"It puts me at peace; when I'm playing well, maybe I'll hit a couple bad shots, but I can bounce back and you have some good stuff fresh in your memory to go to if you're in a tough spot and you can stay on track.",,,,,
"As a golfer, what areas of focus are most important to you when you're training?",,,,,
"For me, it's keeping my legs strong.",,,,,
Legs are vital for golfers.,,,,,
"When I work, I'm doing a little bit of strength, a little bit of flexibility, and also mobility.",,,,,
"My lats, hips, and shoulders can get really tight, so I try and maintain that flexibility.",,,,,
"When I get tight, I can't move as well, so I really have to keep those flexible if I want to hit well.",,,,,
"With my training, I went back to what I was doing a little earlier in my career.",,,,,
"After winning the FedExCup, I wanted to put on a little bit of muscle, and it was great, but it hindered me a little bit since I didn't take care of my flexibility, so now I've been doing a lot of mobility, and keeping my core strong.",,,,,
"If I can have that strong core and be really mobile, it helps me create a lot of speed in my swing.",,,,,
"If I want to work on leg strength or core stability, I like to do a lot of lunges.",,,,,
"Split stance lunges with a row, or a split stance with a chest press at the end.",,,,,
"It about really allowing the weight to pull you back, and get a deep turn, and then explode into the chest move.",,,,,
"When I first discovered my love of martial arts, I was a shy 18-year-old girl.",,,,,
I'm from a traditional Bangladeshi Muslim background and back then my life in east London was very different.,,,,,
"We didn't have social media, or even mobile phones just going to a friend's house was difficult because my parents were very protective.",,,,,
"I didn't wear much make-up and rather than flick through magazines and read about beauty like other girls my age, I would devour anything I could find about Muhammad Ali and Bruce Lee.",,,,,
"But at 18, my life changed.",,,,,
I went to a Muay Thai class (a form of kickboxing that's generally regarded as the world's toughest martial art) and found something I'd never experienced before.,,,,,
"I'd always been naturally good at sport at school, but this gave me a challenge and an escape from my own head when I was doing it, I felt completely focused.",,,,,
"Unsure of how my parents would react to me doing what is often considered to be such a masculine sport, I kept it secret from them and got a part-time job in a chemist to be able to pay for classes.",,,,,
"Every Sunday, I'd get up really early, do all my chores around the house and ask politely if I could go to the gym my mum had no idea that I was going to a martial arts gym that was 90% full of tough, macho guys.",,,,,
But I wasn't phased by walking into that environment.,,,,,
"I felt no pressure and I wasn't trying to prove myself to anyone , if anything, I felt like myself there.",,,,,
"When I'm training and competing, I don't care about the way I look.",,,,,
I feel confident in just being me.,,,,,
I'll wear a really hydrating moisturiser so that my skin feels good but that's all.,,,,,
"Away from the ring, it's a different story.",,,,,
I love fashion and makeup.,,,,,
"Thanks to my career I became the British and world champion for Muay Thai boxing for my weight category in 2016; I go to a lot of awards ceremonies, and for those, I like to wear heels and a beautiful dress.",,,,,
"I'll go with foundation, concealer, lipstick, blusher and maybe a highlighter if I'm in the mood.",,,,,
I have an extensive makeup collection I like to look elegant and pretty when I'm away from the gym but I still want to look like me.,,,,,
No fake eyelashes!,,,,,
"As a society, we're keen to put people into boxes either you're sporty or glamorous, you can't be both but that's not true.",,,,,
I can be taken seriously as an athlete and look glamorous when I'm outside the ring.,,,,,
"I firmly believe that when it comes to how you look and who you are, you should never try to please other people if you're pleased with yourself, then it will radiate through.",,,,,
"When I started doing this, I was simply following a passion.",,,,,
"Later on, I realised that I had become a role model and I didn't know how to embrace that.",,,,,
"But eventually, I said to myself, you've got an amazing platform to really inspire the next generation: to inspire girls, Muslim women, people with ME and chronic fatigue (I've suffered for years), people from ethnic minorities, people from low-income backgrounds these are all obstacles I've faced in my own journey.",,,,,
"But I've succeeded and because of that I feel confident and, yes, beautiful too.",,,,,
"Being beautiful is simply about being bold and embracing who you are that, combined with learning your craft and working hard, is what makes people respect you.",,,,,
"At the moment, so many girls are reluctant to pursue sport and I think that's often because they see it as somehow unfeminine.",,,,,
That's something I'm determined to change.,,,,,
"I train girls and some of them comment on my Instagram feed, and say it's amazing that I don't use filters to make myself look better in photos.",,,,,
"I try to explain that I don't need to do that because I'm confident in how I look whether that's sweating and makeup-free in the ring, or all dressed up, in mascara and lipstick.",,,,,
"Either way, I'm comfortable as I am and that's what I want them to feel, too.",,,,,
I want them to discover what their bodies are capable of everyone has strengths and it's about discovering yours and pursuing that.,,,,,
"This year, I've switched from Muay Thai to boxing.",,,,,
It's a completely different discipline.,,,,,
"While I've got the strength and the fighter's mentality from kickboxing, the timing, the balance, the guard and the footwork are all different.",,,,,
"I'm in training twice a day, six days a week, and living on a very strict diet while I build my foundations in this new sport.",,,,,
I know the road might not be straight but I'm not going to give up.,,,,,
A fighter's mentality is about having resilience.,,,,,
"When I'm in the ring, my coach and my manager won't be able to help me.",,,,,
I've got to rely on myself and know how to be my own best friend.,,,,,
"Many female authors rose to prominence in the mid-nineteenth century, a period the literary scholar Elaine Showalter calls The Age of the Female Novelist.",,,,,
But this age also witnessed the development of narrow ideas about women writers and how and what topics they should write about.,,,,,
"In 1904, G.H. Lewes identified sentiment as a consistent feminine literary trait; George Eliot, herself a woman, believed that maternal affections distinguished books written by women.",,,,,
"Despite a century's worth of women's rights movements since then, male (and sometimes female) writers still talk about female authors through the lens of The Lady Writer.",,,,,
"In 1965, Bernard Bergonzi explained that women novelists like to keep their focus narrow on domestic topics, while more recently, V.S. Naipaul declared no living or dead female author could be his equal because they are bogged down by their limited, sentimental sense of the world.",,,,,
Gay Talese claims that not a single female writer has influenced his work.,,,,,
This has been the unyielding consensus since the 1880s: Women writers are excessively emotional and can only write about things like family or feelings.,,,,,
"Since the early 2000s, gender inequality in the culture industry literature, music, and film has become the site of increasing protest.",,,,,
Calls for more and better roles for women in mainstream movies have become commonplace in the last five years.,,,,,
"In the world of writing, gender bias has come to be seen as particularly entrenched, and in 2009, VIDA a group of volunteers interested in drawing attention to gender inequality in the field of book reviewing began what they called the count.",,,,,
The results of their study proved withering from the start.,,,,,
Men appeared 66 percent more often in The New York Times Book Review.,,,,,
Three times more often in the London Review of Books.,,,,,
"Other magazines, such as The Times Literary Supplement, had even worse numbers.",,,,,
"These numbers are valuable because they can track how often publications deign to review books by women, but what they can't track is how reviewers then treat women's work: how they write about women and the stereotypes they invoke.",,,,,
This is where our project began.,,,,,
We decided to analyze the contents of recent book reviews to see if men and women were written about differently when their books were under review.,,,,,
And we wanted to see if anything had changed over the last 15 years.,,,,,
We chose to focus on The New York Times for two reasons.,,,,,
"First, The New York Times Book Review is widely seen as a powerful gatekeeper; a good or bad review can determine a book's overall reception, and thus, if there are changing trends in the book-reviewing world, we would find it there.",,,,,
"Second, TheÊNew York Times has been directly responsive to the VIDA study in acknowledging gender imbalance in its pages and seeking to address this problem.",,,,,
The improving numbers at The New York Times are often pointed to as evidence that things are getting better.,,,,,
Women always wanted equality until it comes to pay the bills,,,,,
